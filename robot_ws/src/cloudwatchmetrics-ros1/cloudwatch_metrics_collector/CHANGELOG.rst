  * Addressed review comments
  * Add reading of parameters from config file
  - Add reading of CloudWatch upload and file management settings from the
  config file. This is very similar to CloudWatchLogs parameter reading
  but using a different base CloudWatchOptions with some different default
  settings
  - Add sample configuration file that has all the same values as the
  default values for each option in alphabetical order.

  * Disable trigger_publish_size by default. Add comment that it cannot be larger than max_queue_size
  * Move advanced configuration to README, code style fixes
  - Move all the advanced configuration parameters for offline metrics to the
  README instead of the sample configuration.
  - Improve parameter reading to re-use functions more and not return any
  codes if they're just going to be ignored.
